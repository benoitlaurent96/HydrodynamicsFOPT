# HydrodynamicsFOPT
Module for solving hydrodynamics equation during a first-order phase transition

## Features

- Finds the solution of the fluid and matching equations.
- Uses the template model to approximate the EOS.
- Finds the LTE wall velocity.
- Can also find the out-of-equilibrium wall velocity if a desidered entropy production fraction is provided.
- Can be used for direct and inverse FOPTs.


## Installation

pip install -e .
```

## Example

```python
print("Hello world")
```

## Requirements
